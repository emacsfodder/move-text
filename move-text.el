;;; Commentary:
;;
;; MoveText 2.0.0 is a re-write of the old move-text and compatible with >= Emacs 25.1
;;
;; It allows you to move the current line using M-up / M-down if a
;; region is marked, it will move the region instead.
;;
;; Using the prefix (C-u *number* or META *number*) you can predefine how
;; many lines move-text will travel.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put move-text.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'move-text)
;; (move-text-default-bindings)

Note: `region-beginning' and `region-end' are the reason why an
`interactive' macro with \"r\" will blow up with the error:

\"The mark is not set now, so there is no region\"

We check with `use-region-p' to avoid calling
them when there's no region or it is not appropriate
to act on it.

We use `prefix-numeric-value' to return a number.
